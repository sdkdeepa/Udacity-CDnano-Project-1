# Deploying Static website in AWS

The cloud is perfect for hosting static websites that only include HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files that require no server-side processing. In this project, you will deploy a static website to AWS.

- First, you will create an S3 bucket, configure the bucket for website hosting, and secure it using IAM policies.

- Next, you will upload the website files to your bucket and speed up content delivery using AWSâ€™s content distribution network service, CloudFront.

- Lastly, you will access your website in a browser using the unique S3 endpoint.

Note: In step 4 of the project instruction(Secure Bucket via IAM), disable "Blocking public access" to allow public access.(Had to figure out on my own. This step has changed as of 10/25/2020).
